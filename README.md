1. function searchPosition(): This line defines a function named searchPosition that takes two parameters: an array $nums and a target number $target.

2. $length = count($nums): This line calculates the length of the array $nums using the count function and assigns it to the variable $length.

3. for ($i = 0; $i < $length; $i++): This line starts a loop that iterates over each element of the array $nums using the variable $i as an index.

4. if ($nums[$i] >= $target): This line checks if the current element of the array $nums at index $i is greater than or equal to the target number $target.

5. return $i: If the condition in the previous step is met, this line returns the index $i where the first number greater than or equal to the target is found.

6. return $length: If no such number is found in the array, this line returns the length of the array $length.

7. $nums = [1, 3, 2, 6]: This line initializes an array $nums with the values 1, 3, 2, and 6.

8. $target = 7: This line initializes the variable $target with the value 7.

9. echo searchPosition($nums, $target);: This line calls the searchPosition function with the array $nums and target number $target as arguments, and then echoes (outputs) the result.
